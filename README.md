# Mainteny Assignment

This web app was made using :

### `Frontend`

### `Backend`

- Express JS

### `Database`

- Mongo DB

## FEATURES :

- Admin can view all the students present in the database

### `How to run the application : `

Clone the repository using

```
git clone https://github.com/Zishan-7/Mainteny-Assesment.git
```

Head on to the project root folder

```
cd Mainteny-Assesment

```

## Let's start the backend server first :

```
cd server

```

Install the dependencies

```

npm install

```

Start the server

```

npm start

```

You will see in the console, server will start at localhost:3001

<b>
NOTE : You don't have to set up the database, the Mongo databse used is already hosted on MongoDB atlas, you can see the databse URL in the .env file present in the server folder (I know that it is not safe to commit env file to github but I had to do it to keep things simple for getting the webapp started)
</b>

Open a new terminal in project root folder

<br>

```

npm install

```
